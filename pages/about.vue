    Why I Made The Site 
    </div>
<div class="info_why">
I made this site because of a project in school. We were tasked with doing a blog type of website.
I didn't really have something to make a blog about but then I thought of another way of doing it. 
I could make a "blog" but really it was just a site about something I like, 
so therefore I made this site about NBA players, the ones i like and the most famous ones. 
And from there I could just make it a sort of fact site about the players, instead of a regular blog.
